## Stage 0: Foundation & Test Harness

### Objectives
- Initialize Next.js project with BuildVision stack
- Configure ShadCN with new-york style
- Set up globals.css with BuildVision design tokens
- Create core TypeScript interfaces (Email, Project, Purchaser, Seller, Bid)
- Build AI provider abstraction layer (GPT/Gemini/Claude)
- GitHub repo setup

### Checklist
- [ ] Project initialized with `bunx create-next-app@latest`
- [ ] ShadCN configured with components.json
- [ ] globals.css set up with BuildVision tokens
- [ ] Core TypeScript interfaces created
- [ ] AI provider abstraction implemented
- [ ] GitHub repo connected (`git@github.com:mrhoo2/email-bdc-agent.git`)
- [ ] Initial commit pushed

### Test Checkpoint
- [ ] Project builds without errors (`bun build`)
- [ ] Development server starts (`bun dev`)
- [ ] All three AI providers connect successfully
- [ ] Mock data displays in test UI

### Test Results
*To be filled after testing*

### Notes
*Session-specific notes*

## Stage 1: Gmail Integration (Backfill Mode)

### Objectives
- Configure Google Cloud OAuth credentials
- Implement Gmail OAuth flow (read-only scope)
- Create email fetching service (batch historical fetch)
- Build email viewer component

### Checklist

- Created `lib/gmail/index.ts` - Email fetching, parsing, batch operations
- Created `app/api/auth/gmail/route.ts` - OAuth initiation endpoint
- Created `app/api/auth/gmail/callback/route.ts` - OAuth callback handler
- Created `app/api/emails/route.ts` - Email fetching API
- Created `components/gmail/GmailConnectionCard.tsx` - Connection UI
- Created `components/gmail/EmailList.tsx` - Email list with pagination
- Created `components/gmail/EmailViewer.tsx` - Full email viewer
- Updated `app/page.tsx` - Integrated Gmail components
